# diaryApp

"Diary" is an application that allows users to keep track of journal entries. You can create entries, update and delete them, and retrieve them by date form the database.

Scaling up, I'd want users to be able to add friends, and by user permission, read other people's entries. I'd also want to add a real-time meassging feature. That would be lit.
